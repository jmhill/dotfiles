# Working With Me

## Core Principles
- TDD is non-negotiable: failing test first, minimal code to pass, assess refactor value
- Immutable data and pure functions where possible
- Early returns over nested conditionals
- Self-documenting code over comments

## Communication
- Be explicit about trade-offs
- Flag any guideline deviations with justification
- Ask when requirements are ambiguous
